#### A convenient way to set up, manage and use localized routes in a Laravel app.

- [Automatically register](#-register-routes) a route for each locale you wish to support.
- Use [route slugs or custom domains](#-supported-locales) (or subdomains)
- Optionally remove the locale slug from the URL for your main language.
- [Generate localized route URL's](#-generate-route-urls) in the simplest way using the `route()` helper.
- [Redirect to localized routes](#-redirect-to-routes) using the `redirect()->route()` helper.
- [Generate localized signed route URL's](#-generate-signed-route-urls)
- Allow routes to be [cached](#-cache-routes).
- Optionally [translate each segment](#-translate-routes) in your URI's.
- **Let you work with routes without thinking too much about locales.**

## ✅ Requirements

- PHP >= 7.1
- Laravel >= 5.6

## 📦 Install

```php
composer require codezero/laravel-localized-routes
```

> Laravel will automatically register the ServiceProvider.

## ⚙️ Configure

#### ☑️ Publish Configuration File

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\LocalizedRoutesServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

You will now find a `localized-routes.php` file in the `config` folder.

#### ☑️ Supported Locales

##### Using Slugs

Add any locales you wish to support to your published `config/localized-routes.php` file:

```php
'supported-locales' => ['en', 'nl', 'fr'],
```

 This will automically prepend a slug to your localized routes. [More on this below](#-register-routes).

##### Using Domains

Alternatively, you can use a different domain or subdomain for each locale by adding them to the `supported-locales` like this:

```php
'supported-locales' => [
  'en' => 'example.com',
  'nl' => 'nl.example.com',
  'fr' => 'fr.example.com',
],
```

#### ☑️ Omit Slug for Main Locale

Specify your main locale if you want to omit its slug from the URL:

```php
'omit_url_prefix_for_locale' => null
```

Setting this option to `'en'` will result, for example, in URL's like this:

- English: `/some-url` instead of the default `/en/some-url`
- Dutch: `/nl/some-url` as usual
- French: `/fr/some-url` as usual

> This option has no effect if you use domains instead of slugs.

#### Automatically Set Locale for Localized Routes

To automatically set the locale when a localized route is active via a middleware simply set the option to true:

```php
'use_locale_middleware' => true
```

Alternatively, you can omit it completely or specify it for a specific route or route group:

```php
Route::localized(function () {

    Route::get('about', AboutController::class.'@index')
        ->name('about')
        ->middleware(\CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\Middleware\LocalizedRouteLocaleHandler::class);

    Route::group(
        [
            'as' => 'admin.',
            'middleware' => [\CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\Middleware\LocalizedRouteLocaleHandler::class],
        ],
        function () {
            Route::get('admin/reports', ReportsController::class.'@index')
                ->name('reports.index');
        });

});
```

#### ☑️ Set Options for the Current Localized Route Group

To set an option for one localized route group only, you can specify it as the second parameter of the localized route macro:

```php
Route::localized(function () {

    Route::get('about', AboutController::class.'@index')
        ->name('about');

}, [
    'supported-locales' => ['en', 'nl', 'fr'],
    'omit_url_prefix_for_locale' => null,
    'use_locale_middleware' => false,
]);
```

## 🚗 Register Routes

Example:

```php
// Not localized
Route::get('home', HomeController::class.'@index')
    ->name('home');

// Localized
Route::localized(function () {

    Route::get('about', AboutController::class.'@index')
        ->name('about');

    Route::name('admin.')->group(function () {
        Route::get('admin/reports', ReportsController::class.'@index')
            ->name('reports.index');
    });

});
```

In the above example there are 5 routes being registered. The routes defined in the `Route::localized` closure are automatically registered for each configured locale. This will prepend the locale to the route's URI and name. If you configured custom domains, it will use those instead of the slugs.

| URI               | Name                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| /home             | home                   |
| /en/about         | en.about               |
| /nl/about         | nl.about               |
| /en/admin/reports | en.admin.reports.index |
| /nl/admin/reports | nl.admin.reports.index |

If you set `omit_url_prefix_for_locale` to `'en'` in the configuration file, the resulting routes look like this: 

| URI               | Name                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| /home             | home                   |
| /about            | en.about               |
| /nl/about         | nl.about               |
| /admin/reports    | en.admin.reports.index |
| /nl/admin/reports | nl.admin.reports.index |

**⚠️ Beware that you don't register the same URL twice when omitting the locale.** You can't have a localized `/about` route and also register a non-localized `/about` route in this case. The same idea applies to the `/` (root) route! Also note that the route names still have the locale prefix.

### 🚕 Generate Route URL's

You can get the URL of your named routes as usual, using the `route()` helper.

##### 👎 The ugly way...

Normally you would have to include the locale whenever you want to generate a URL:

```php
$url = route(app()->getLocale().'.admin.reports.index');
```

##### 👍 A much nicer way...

Because the former is rather ugly, this package overwrites the `route()` function and the underlying `UrlGenerator` class with an additional, optional `$locale` argument and takes care of the locale prefix for you. If you don't specify a locale, either a normal, non-localized route or a route in the current locale is returned.

```php
route($name, $parameters = [], $absolute = true, $locale = null)
```

A few examples:

```php
app()->setLocale('en');
app()->getLocale(); // 'en'

$url = route('home'); // /home (normal routes have priority)
$url = route('about'); // /en/about (current locale)

// Get specific locales...
// This is most useful if you want to generate a URL to switch language.
$url = route('about', [], true, 'en'); // /en/about
$url = route('about', [], true, 'nl'); // /nl/about

// You could also do this, but it kinda defeats the purpose...
$url = route('en.about'); // /en/about
$url = route('en.about', [], true, 'nl'); // /nl/about
```

> **Note:** in a most practical scenario you would register a route either localized **or** non-localized, but not both. If you do, you will always need to specify a locale to get the URL, because non-localized routes always have priority when using the `route()` function.

### 🚌 Redirect to Routes

Laravel's `Redirector` uses the same `UrlGenerator` as the `route()` function behind the scenes. Because we are overriding this class, you can easily redirect to your routes.

```php
return redirect()->route('home'); // redirects to /home
return redirect()->route('about'); // redirects to /en/about (current locale)
```

You can't redirect to URL's in a specific locale this way, but if you need to, you can of course just use the `route()` function.

```php
return redirect(route('about', [], true, 'nl')); // redirects to /nl/about
```

### ✍🏻 Generate Signed Route URL's

Generating a [signed route URL](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/urls#signed-urls) is just as easy.

Pass it the route name, the nescessary parameters and you will get the URL for the current locale.

```php
$signedUrl = URL::signedRoute('reset.password', ['user' => $id], now()->addMinutes(30));
```

You can also generate a signed URL for a specific locale:

```php
$signedUrl = URL::signedRoute($name, $parameters, $expiration, true, 'nl');
```

Check out the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/urls#signed-urls) for more info on signed routes.

### 🌎 Translate Routes

If you want to translate the segments of your URI's, create a `routes.php` language file for each locale you [configured](#configure-supported-locales):

```
resources
 └── lang
      ├── en
      │    └── routes.php
      └── nl
           └── routes.php
```

In these files, add a translation for each segment.

```php
// lang/nl/routes.php
return [
    'about' => 'over',
    'us' => 'ons',
];
```

Now you can use our `Lang::uri()` macro during route registration:

```php
Route::localized(function () {

    Route::get(Lang::uri('about/us'), AboutController::class.'@index')
        ->name('about.us');

});
```

The above will generate:

- /en/about/us
- /nl/over/ons

> If a translation is not found, the original segment is used.

## 🚏 Route Placeholders

Placeholders are not translated via language files. These are values you would provide via the `route()` function. The `Lang::uri()` macro will skip any placeholder segment.

If you have a model that uses a route key that is translated in the current locale, then you can still simply pass the model to the `route()` function to get translated URL's.

An example...

#### Given we have a model like this:

```php
class Post extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
{
    public function getRouteKey()
    {
        $slugs = [
            'en' => 'en-slug',
            'nl' => 'nl-slug',
        ];

        return $slugs[app()->getLocale()];
    }
}
```

> **TIP:** checkout [spatie/laravel-translatable](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-translatable) for translatable models.

#### If we have a localized route like this:

```php
Route::localized(function () {

    Route::get('posts/{post}', PostsController::class.'@show')
        ->name('posts.show');

});
```

#### We can now get the URL with the appropriate slug:

```php
app()->setLocale('en');
app()->getLocale(); // 'en'

$post = new Post;

$url = route('posts.show', $post); // /en/posts/en-slug
$url = route('posts.show', $post, true, 'nl'); // /nl/posts/nl-slug
```

## 🗃 Cache Routes

In production you can safely cache your routes per usual.

```php
php artisan route:cache
```

## 🚧 Testing

```
composer test
```
