# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading To 3.0 From 2.x

### âž¡ Minimum Requirements Updated

We dropped support for Laravel 5.6, 5.7, 5.8 and 6.x.

- The minimum PHP version required is now 7.2.5
- The minimum Laravel version required is now 7.0

### âž¡ Middleware Changes

Applying the `CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\Middleware\SetLocale` middleware is now more straightforward.

The middleware is no longer automatically applied to localized routes if the `use_locale_middleware` option is set to `true`.

If you choose to use the middleware, you need to apply it manually to your routes.

```php
protected $middlewarePriority = [
    \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class, // <= after this
    //...
    \CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\Middleware\SetLocale::class,
    \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class, // <= before this
];
```

ðŸ”¸ **Actions Required**

- Remove the `use_locale_middleware` option from your published `config/localized-routes.php` config file.
- Remove the `use_localizer` option from your published `config/localized-routes.php` config file.
- Make sure you apply the middleware to your routes manually, either on specific routes or route groups, or by adding it to the `web` middleware group in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Make sure you also add the middleware to the `$middlewarePriority` array in `app/Http/Kernel.php` in the correct spot:

### âž¡ Supported Locales, Slugs and Domains

The `supported-locales` config option has been renamed to `supported_locales`, using an underscore for consistency.

The `omit_url_prefix_for_locale` config option has been renamed to `omitted_locale`.

You can now configure your supported locales in 3 formats.

```php
// A simple array; in this case, the locales
// will be used as slugs in the URLs.
'supported_locales' => ['en', 'nl'];

// An array with locale / domain pairs, where the locale
// is used for route names etc., and the domain for the URL.
'supported_locales' => [
    'en' => 'english-domain.test',
    'nl' => 'dutch-domain.test',
];

// An array with locale / slug pairs, where the locale
// is used for route names etc., and the slug for the URL.
'supported_locales' => [
    'en' => 'english-slug',
    'nl' => 'dutch-slug',
];
```

ðŸ”¸ **Actions Required**

- Remove the `custom_prefixes` option from your published `config/localized-routes.php` config file.
- Rename the `supported-locales` option to `supported_locales`
- Make sure you configure the `supported_locales` option properly if you are using custom slugs.
- Slugs can not contain dots, because then it is considered a domain.
- Rename the `omit_url_prefix_for_locale` option to `omitted_locale`

### âž¡ Custom Route Action Changed

During route registration, we set the locale on the route using a custom route action.
We changed this route action from `laravel-localized-routes` to simply `locale`.
We also added an option to the config file in case you need to change this name.

ðŸ”¸ **Actions Required**

- If you are using the `laravel-localized-routes` route action in your own code, you can either update your code with the new `locale` route action, or change it back to `laravel-localized-routes` by setting the `route_action` option in the config file.

### âž¡ Changed `FallbackController` Namespace

The namespace of the `FallbackController` has been pluralized to `CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\Controllers`.

ðŸ”¸ **Actions Required**

- If you use the `FallbackController`, update the namespace from `CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\Controller\FallbackController` to `CodeZero\LocalizedRoutes\Controllers\FallbackController`.

### âž¡ Renamed `Route::localizedHas()` Method

The `Route::localizedHas()` method has been renamed to `Route::hasLocalized()` to be consistent with `Route::isLocalized()`.

ðŸ”¸ **Actions Required**

- Replace any occurrence of `Route::localizedHas()` with `Route::hasLocalized()`.
